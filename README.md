# fly-olfactory-learning-model
A behavior-first, imaging-ready framework for modeling Drosophila olfactory learning. Builds trial-level datasets from proboscis traces, encodes odors via DoOR, and implements online, biologically inspired plasticity to infer and control learning dynamics in closed-loop experiments.
